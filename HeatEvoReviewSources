Hello! This is Clabel here, and below are the sources that I used to construct my NASCAR Heat Evolution video! If you believe the information below is incorrect, and something that should be credited is not credited, then by all means reach to me on Twitter at @Clabel_ or through my email which is connected to my YouTube page through the "About" section.

As well, the review was constructed under the means of fair use law, following the "criticism" and "comment" behavior held under Section 7, Chapter 1 of the Title 17 known as the Copyright Law of the United States

https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/#:~:text=About%20Fair%20Use&text=Section%20107%20of%20the%20Copyright,may%20qualify%20as%20fair%20use.

Any footage that was used was used to put forth/add to a message, and was not done through means of copyright infringement. 

As well, any damage this review may cause to the game in question "NASCAR Heat Evolution" is redundant, as the game itself is 6 years old and no damage can be done to the market of the game, only to those involved in the project. Any negative reaction from developer or publisher is seen to me as "overreacting" and "immature" given the nature of this video was to critique, not cause a shouting match between me and those involved. 

I respect those that worked on this game and the mere intent of some of lines that may be seen as "offensive" and, ironically, "immature", are used as a means to put forth humor and entertainment towards an audience, while at the same time critiquing the game to the best of my abilities. 

The songs used in the background as well followed fair use law as the audio in the video falls under the guards of a "transformative use". Meaning, the audio in the video accompanying the music is pushing forth a different purpose and not meant to replace the listening experience of the songs shown. 

I am not a dedicated "expert" on Fair Use, but I did my best to follow along the guidelines as such.
